# 🌐 TriangleMeshLighting

**TriangleMeshLighting** is a **.NET Windows Forms** application that visualizes a **triangulated 3rd-degree Bezier surface** using a **Lambertian lighting model** and **barycentric approximation** for polygon rendering. The program allows users to define control points, generates a triangulated mesh, and visualizes the result with dynamic lighting and customizable parameters.

## 📝 Overview
The program constructs a **triangular mesh** representing the **3rd-degree Bezier surface** by interpolating control points in the \((x, y)\) domain. The lighting on the surface is computed using the **Lambertian lighting model**, which simulates realistic diffuse shading based on the object's orientation relative to the light source.

The Bezier surface is defined by:
\[
z(x, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{3} \sum_{j=0}^{3} z_{i,j} B_{i,3}(x) B_{j,3}(y), \quad x, y \in [0, 1]
\]
where \( z_{i,j} \) are control points, and \( B_{n}(t) \) represents the Bernstein basis polynomial:
\[
B_{i,n}(t) = \binom{n}{i} t^i (1 - t)^{n - i}
\]

## 💡 Lighting Model
The lighting is calculated using the **Lambertian model**:
\[
I = k_a \cdot I_L \cdot I_O + k_d \cdot I_L \cdot I_O \cdot \cos(\theta_{N,L}) + k_s \cdot I_L \cdot I_O \cdot \cos^m(\theta_{V,R})
\]
where:
- \( k_a, k_d, k_s, m \) – material coefficients (ambient, diffuse, specular).
- \( I_L \) – light intensity.
- \( I_O \) – object color.
- \( N \) – surface normal vector.
- \( L \) – light direction vector.
- \( V \) – viewing vector.
- \( R \) – reflection vector.
